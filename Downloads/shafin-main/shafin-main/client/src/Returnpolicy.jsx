          We'll take the tshirt back in case there is any quality issue
                  with either the print, or the tshirt. You need to notify us
                  within 1 days of receiving your order. Incase of sizing
                  issues, there is no return/refund. Our tshirts are printed on
                  demand, and if there is a return for size issues, it is
                  practically dead stock to us.
